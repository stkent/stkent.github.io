Detroit Labs partnered with local tech trainers Grand Circus to run an iOS development bootcamp during the Fall of 2015. I gave this 75-minute talk during the final week of classes, with the goal being to inform and prepare the students for their transitions into the world of professional software development. **Major themes**: communication and self-directed learning!
