A developer tool for comparing stock Android interpolators in slow motion. Users can also create and animate their own custom interpolators. Featured in [Android Weekly #139](http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-139).

I wrote and released the initial version of this app in one week as part of the [Detroit Labs App-A-Week Challenge](http://www.detroitlabs.com/blog/2015/2/17/t3axsa6jufq56bnlo175k2g7k1r9fa).
