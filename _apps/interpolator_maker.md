A developer tool for comparing stock Android animation interpolators in slow motion. As a bonus, the app allows devs to type in their own interpolating expression and immediately animate the result.

The initial version of the app was written and released in one week as part of the [Detroit Labs App-A-Week Challenge](http://www.detroitlabs.com/blog/2015/2/17/t3axsa6jufq56bnlo175k2g7k1r9fa).
