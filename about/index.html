<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Today</h2>

<p>I am a software developer at Detroit Labs, currently working on iOS and Android applications. I began developing software professionally in 2014. Opinions expressed on this website are my own, as are any errors. If you spot a mistake, please <a href="mailto:skent.dev@gmail.com">let me know</a> - I hope to use this blog as a vehicle for for both teaching <em>and</em> learning :-)</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Before joining Detroit Labs, I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona. My thesis focused on the development of an accurate and efficient algorithm for calculating equilibrium states of microscopic electro-mechanical systems. You can read more about my research <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6965">here</a>. I also taught several undergraduate Math courses and TA'd graduate Applied Math courses during this time.</p>

<h2>Upcoming</h2>

<p>My current learning yearnings include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Diving much deeper into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/">computer systems</a>;</li>
  <li>Becoming <em>design-literate</em>, starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/">these</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/">books</a> and <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>;</li>
  <li>Improving my understanding of <a href="http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">category theory</a> and its relationship with computing languages;</li>
<li>Exploring <a href="http://fernandocejas.com/2014/08/03/aspect-oriented-programming-in-android/">aspect-oriented programming</a>.</li>
</ul>
