<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm a software developer with 3.5 years' mobile experience. I currently work at Detroit Labs creating native Android and iOS apps for national and international brands in the utilities, QSR, automotive, and pro audio industries. I write about all things software.</p>

<pp>Before becoming a developer I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Math from the University of Arizona and taught several undergraduate classes.</p>

If you'd like to know more about my background and specific experiences, please <a href="mailto:skent.dev@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.
