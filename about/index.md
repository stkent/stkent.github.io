# About Me

## Today

I am a software developer at Detroit Labs, currently working on iOS and Android applications. I began developing software professionally in 2014. Opinions expressed on this website are my own, as are any errors. If you spot a mistake, please [let me know](mailto:skent.dev@gmail.com) - I hope to use this blog as a vehicle for for both teaching _and_ learning :-)

If you enjoy this site, you may also be interested in checking out my:

* public code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stkent);
* community contributions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2911458/stkent?tab=profile);
* occasional off-topic utterances on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skentphd).

## Background

Before joining Detroit Labs, I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona. My thesis focused on the development of an accurate and efficient algorithm for calculating equilibrium states of microscopic electro-mechanical systems. You can read more about my research [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6965). I also taught several undergraduate Math courses and TA'd graduate Applied Math courses during this time.

## Upcoming

My current learning yearnings include but are not limited to:

* Diving much deeper into [computer systems](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/);
* Becoming *design-literate*, starting with [these](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/) [books](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/) and [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/);
* Improving my understanding of [category theory](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) and its relationship with computing languages;
* Exploring [aspect-oriented programming](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/08/03/aspect-oriented-programming-in-android/).
