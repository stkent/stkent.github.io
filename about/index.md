## Today

I am an Android Developer at Detroit Labs, currently working on the [DTE Energy app]({{ site.baseurl }}/apps#dte-energy). I began developing software professionally in 2014.

* occasional off-topic utterances on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skentphd).

## Background

Before joining Detroit Labs, I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona. My thesis focused on the development of an accurate and efficient algorithm for calculating equilibrium states of microscopic electro-mechanical systems. You can read more about my research [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6965). I also taught several undergraduate Math courses and TA'd graduate Applied Math courses during this time.

## Up Next

My current learning yearnings include but are not limited to:

* Getting to grips with [Swift and iOS development](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099);
* Diving much deeper into [computer systems](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/);
* Becoming *design-literate*, starting with [these](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/) [books](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/) and [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/);
* Improving my understanding of [category theory](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) and its relationship with computing languages;
* Exploring [aspect-oriented programming](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/08/03/aspect-oriented-programming-in-android/).
