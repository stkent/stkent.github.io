BugShaker-Android allows your testers and/or users to easily submit bug reports by shaking their device. When a shake is detected, the current screen state is captured and the user is prompted to submit a bug report via email with this screenshot attached.

The iOS version of BugShaker was written by [Dan Trenz](https://github.com/dtrenz) and is available [here](https://github.com/detroit-labs/BugShaker). This Android version builds on Square's shake-detection library, [seismic](https://github.com/square/seismic).
