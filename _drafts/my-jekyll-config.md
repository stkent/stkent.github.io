Over the past few years, the software industry has come to recognize the importance of providing developers with opportunities to pursue side-projects. Google’s “Innovation Time Off”, which encourages engineers to spend 20 percent of their time contributing to any internal project they are interested in, has spawned a number of high-profile products - including Gmail, Google News, and AdSense. [1,2] The success of this program has since led to the introduction of similar schemes at tech companies of all sizes, typically with two primary goals:

- providing engineers with opportunities to flex their creative muscles, improving engagement and retention;

- exploring product/service spaces outside the company’s core focus.

Detroit Labs’ version of this program dedicates a portion of our non-project time to hacking. Unlike at Google, we are not restricted to working on internal projects (although in-house apps like Flipback, Landmarked, and Finger Treadmill are all hack-time projects). Instead, the rules are simple: you must be learning, and you have to demo what you learned or built at our Demo Day every Friday. Focusing on supporting learning itself (rather than on the products of that learning) allows everyone to develop broader skill-sets [3] - especially valuable for those of us who began our software development careers at Detroit Labs and are not formally trained in computer science.

While hack days are undoubtedly a fantastic perk, it’s not always easy to take part. Two main obstacles crop up frequently:

- the natural ebb and flow of client work leads to busy periods (few people have time to hack);

- context switching - jumping from one project right into another - is notoriously difficult for programmers. [4]

At the end of 2014, Detroit Labs introduced a new internal initiative called “App A Week” to augment our existing hack day schedule and address the issues highlighted above. A participating developer has one week to work full-time on an app idea of their choice, and that app must be shipped to the store at the end of the week. Developers can choose to take the challenge whenever they are in-between client projects, and context switching is significantly reduced when compared to building the same app in available hack days. The narrower focus of this initiative compared to regular hack days actually leads to a number of additional benefits:

- developers gain more platform expertise by exploring features they have not previously had the opportunity to use;

- developers become more familiar with the app submission and release processes;

- everyone involved (developers, designers etc.) learns how to produce a suitably-scoped minimum viable product;

- Detroit Labs builds a diverse portfolio of compact, polished applications that demonstrate we can make quality products quickly.

A lot of the skills learned by going through this exercise also feed back into client projects - it pays to have developers using newly-released features and APIs to keep client apps cutting-edge, but it’s often best to trial those features in smaller projects first before committing to change in a much larger app.

To date we have had two App-A-Week challengers: @_chelseybaker (My Memory Jar) and @skentphd (Interpolator Maker). Chelsey documented her experience on twitter using the #DLAppAWeek hashtag, and Stuart has a blog post in-progress. Keep your eyes peeled for future App-A-Week challenges, and join us for the journey!
