[Oh look, another talk comparing modern mobile technologies! This time, the primary audience is iOS developers who are familiar with Swift and intrigued by Android. If you're a Kotlin-curious Android or Java developer, you might get more out of my previous talk, _[Kotlin For Fun And Profit]({% post_url 2017-07-13-kotlin-for-fun-and-profit %})_.]

Last week, I crashed my [local CocoaHeads meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MotorCityCocoaHeads/) and gave a talk about... Android!

Sort of ðŸ˜‰.

Several key aspects of the iOS and Android developer experiences have converged within the last year:

- The languages with which we may now express our application logic (Swift and Kotlin) are syntactically and philosophically similar;

- The layout tools with which we define our application UI provide options that prioritize performance and power (Auto Layout and `ConstraintLayout`) as well as options that prioritize convenience and easier maintenance (`UIStackView` and `LinearLayout`);

- The IDEs that support our development efforts have continued to borrow the best features from one another: recent examples include Android Studio offering integrated run-time view debugging, and Xcode (re-)adding powerful refactoring capabilities.

This means there's never been a better time for developers familiar with one ecosystem to learn the other. And you should: it's a lot easier than learning your first native platform, and with a little effort you'll quickly find yourself:

- saving time by solving problems once, not twice,

- more easily maintaining consistency when building dual-platform apps, and

- becoming a more flexible (and therefore more valuable) employee ðŸ¤‘,

all without sacrificing any of the benefits of native development.
