[Self Conference 2016](http://selfconference.org/) wrapped up today! Held here in Detroit, it's an annual get-together where we talk about tech, people, and especially tech people. Having attended and enjoyed the conference immensely in 2014 and 2015, I was thrilled to be returning as a speaker this year! Check out the video (audio + slides) of my talk, "The Human Context: Exploring Google's Nearby APIs" below!

I also took this opportunity to upload all my previous tech talks to [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/stkent), and to revamp my [Talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks) page to show:

- an embedded video of the talk, if available;
- embedded talk slides otherwise.

Here's a quick before and after:
