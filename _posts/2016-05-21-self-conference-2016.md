[Self Conference 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314062439/http://selfconference.org/){:new_tab} wrapped up today! Held in Detroit, it's an annual get-together where we talk about tech, people, and especially tech people. Having attended and enjoyed the conference immensely in 2014 and 2015, I was thrilled to be returning as a speaker this year. Check out the video (audio + slides) of my talk, “The Human Context: Exploring Google's Nearby APIs” below.
