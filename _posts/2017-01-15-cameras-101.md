Towards the end of 2016, I participated in one of Detroit Labs’ occasional Lightning Talk lunches. 5-6 speakers get ~7 minutes each to talk about any topic they would like. Here’s an audio+slide recording of the talk I gave on camera (and DSLR) basics:

As I mention at the end of the talk, there’s a _whole_ lot more I could say on this topic! Photography is a fascinating mix of technical, practical, philosophical, and sociological elements.

The resource I recommend to everyone for further reading on photography principles is [Cambridge in Colour](http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/){:new_tab}. They appear to have added a book version of the site since the last time I visited, so if you enjoy their material, please consider supporting their efforts by picking up a copy :)
