summary: This is a post that allows me to check my Jekyll configuration quickly. I want to type a bunch of stuff here so I can adjust line spacing and that sort of stuffs.

Code sample:

{% highlight ruby %}
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Wow this Ruby source code highlighting looks great!
  has_many :user_assignments, :dependent > :destroy test code test code test code test code test code test code
  has_many :hospitals, :through > :user_assignments
end
{% endhighlight %}

\\( \LaTeX \\) sample:
\\[\frac{1}{x^2}\\]

> This is a blockquote, I made it kind of long because I definitely wanted to see what it looks like when it wraps onto a second line.

Image sample:

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ic_github.png"></p>

**Here is some bold text**.

_Here is some italic text_.

Here is some `inline code`.
