I recently watched Chiu-Ki Chan's Droidcon Boston keynote titled ["How to be an Android Expert"](https://slideslive.com/38900610/how-to-be-an-android-expert). Her core messages - that sharing builds expertise, and that the barrier to sharing can be lower than you think if you approach it correctly - inspired me to get back to blogging. In particular, I'm going to focus on writing shorter, simpler posts.

In February I gave my second[^1] Detroit Labs Lightning Talk. This time I went back to my mathematical roots in search of a topic, and decided to present a _deadly_ proof. This is life or death, people! Check out the video and slides below.
