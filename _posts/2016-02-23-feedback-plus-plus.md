Last week, I gave an internal talk at Detroit Labs about peer feedback. We discussed different types of feedback (appreciation, coaching, and evaluation), and how to get better at giving and guiding each kind. Check out the video (slides + audio) below!

This was a tricky talk to give, quite far outside my comfort zone (technical topics, hooray!).

I'll post PDF slides later this week. The book referenced throughout the talk is [Thanks For The Feedback](http://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0670014664). Please feel free to leave _me_ feedback at [sayat.me](http://sayat.me/stuart). Thanks!
