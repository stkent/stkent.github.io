title: The Case For Asynchronous Feedback

Giving and receiving feedback is vital to professional (and sometimes personal) growth. Despite this, the potential for feedback to be seen as critical or confrontational means it is tempting to delay or avoid delivering it. Kicking the conversation off via an asynchronous communication channel can help.

My team just began trialling [sayat.me](http://sayat.me/)[^1] as a feedback-facilitating service, which prompted me to think more about this topic. The opinions listed below are all influenced by my own experiences, and as such are unlikely to be free of bias (i.e. YMMV). Discussion, debate, and (naturally) feedback on the perspectives shared below are welcome - hit me up in the comments section.

### Pros

#### The feedback provider can craft and double-check their comments.

For feedback to be valuable, it should be both objective and actionable. Sequencing and phrasing can greatly influence how suggestions will be interpreted. Conveying your thoughts in person leaves little margin for error, and any mistakes may be hard to rectify on the spot. On the other hand, writing out feedback allows you to carefully check your tone and phrasing before delivery.

#### The feedback recipient can reflect before a response is required.

Even if your constructive criticism ticks all the right boxes (accurate, neutral, well-phrased, actionable, etc.), the recipient may still be caught off-guard by your insights. That's ok, and totally expected. What's awkward is for the recipient to have to _respond_ to you immediately, before they have had time to digest what you have said. Allowing the recipient time alone to examine your suggestions, think back over their past actions, and place your recommendations in their proper context should ultimately lead to much less defensive, and much more productive, discussions.[^2]

#### Asynchronous communication channels are inherently more impersonal.

Using a less-personal method of communication may help negative feedback feel like less of a personal 'attack'. While careful wording is probably a better way of dealing with this issue, every little helps.

#### Remote workers are not disadvantaged.

The growing popularity of working remotely (especially in tech) has meant that an increasing number of companies now consider universal design principles when establishing their patterns of communication. In general, making any synchronous interactions asynchronous improves remote workers' ability to contribute to those interactions.

#### Most synchronous feedback channels allow optional anonymity.

Though this feature is not exclusive to asynchronous feedback, it sure beats wearing a paper bag over your head. Anonymity may allow people to feel comfortable providing hard-hitting but important feedback that they would never dare deliver face-to-face.

### Cons

#### The nuances of in-person communication are lost.

This is the flip side of pro #3. Sometimes it's really important to be able to react real-time and adjust your delivery accordingly (particularly if the recipient is caught off-guard by your message). That's plain impossible unless you're face-to-face.

#### Con: It may be easier to delay giving asynchronous feedback.
Popular opinion seems to be that feedback should be delivered while any relevant events are still fresh in everyone's minds. It's probably easier to serially postpone writing feedback than it is to repeatedly dodge pre-arranged meetings.

### The bottom line

In my opinion, there are significant upsides to asynchronous feedback delivery _provided_ your team already understand each other's communication styles. If you're not already trading feedback regularly, you should start. And once you do, it's definitely worth spending some time examining your communication patterns - changes are cheap to make!
